            The stiletto blade was forged from a broken fencing foil, while the two piece guard was fashioned from a washer and a piece of rebar to resemble a primrose in bloom flanked by two buds. The handle was made from a brass piece salvaged from the broken hilt of a stage fencing dagger, stacked copper and steel sheets ground down into a fused ferrule, and a piece of bamboo.

            The head and upper portion of the shaft of this warhamer were pineapple twisted to give the appearance of thorns, while the braided twist near the base of the handle was intended to evoke roots.
